## 📌 Problem Statement

Cloud storage systems rely on static tiering policies that result in:

- 15–25% potential cost wastage  
- Inefficient storage allocation  
- No intelligent prediction of access patterns  
- Poor differentiation between AI-generated and human-generated data  

This leads to unnecessary storage expenses and suboptimal cloud utilization.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We propose an **AI-powered Cloud Storage Optimization Recommendation System** that:

- Detects AI-generated data using C2P-CLIP model  
- Predicts access patterns using recency scoring  
- Calculates a dynamic Utility Score  
- Recommends optimal storage tiers (Hot / Cold / Archive)  
- Provides real-time cost optimization insights  

---

## 🧠 Core Innovation

### Utility Score Formula

Utility Score = (0.6 × Recency Score) – (0.4 × AI Generated Penalty)

- High Score → Hot Storage  
- Medium Score → Cold Storage  
- Low Score → Archive  

This dual-detection approach improves cost savings significantly compared to static tiering.
